# vuex-for-everyone

This is part of the [VueSchool Vue.js & JavaScript Courses [Advanced Skills Level]](https://vueschool.io/courses?skill=advanced).
[VueSchool's Vuex For Everyone Course](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuex-for-everyone)
[VueSchool's Repository](https://github.com/vueschool/learn-vuex)

In this course I've learned all there is to know about Vuex by creating a shopping cart from scratch.
I've started off by creating a shopping cart with Vue and then progressively dive into Vuex features as we need them. 
Piece by piece I've replaced parts of our application with mutations, getters, and actions.
I've also learned how to break your Vuex store into modules.
Now I know when and how to use getters, mutations, actions and, how to split your Store with modules.
